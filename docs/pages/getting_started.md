## Getting started with DigiScript

When DigiScript is first loaded, you will see a page similar to the following:

From here, the first thing to do is set up a new show by going to the **System Config** navigation
option. This will give you a page that looks like this:

Now, we need to create a new show. Clicking the **Setup New Show** button will open up a form to
enter the details about your show, including the name, start date and end date.

Finally, now that we have a show created, we need to go ahead and load this show as the current one
since DigiScript can store multiple shows all from the single database! Use the **Load Show** button
to achieve this!

At this point, we've set up and loaded a new show, and we can now move on to 
[Show Configuration](../pages/show_config.md).
