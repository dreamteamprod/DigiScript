## Configuring a Show

### Setting the First Act

Once all acts and scenes have been created and their ordering configured, DigiScript needs to know which act is the first act of the show. This is vital for the correct ordering of the script.

#### Automatic Configuration

DigiScript automatically sets the first act of the show to be the first act that was created. In most cases, if you create your acts in order (Act 1, then Act 2, etc.), this will be configured correctly without any manual intervention.

#### Manual Configuration

If you need to manually change the first act (for example, if you created acts out of order), you can do so by going to the **Configure Show** tab and using the **Edit Show** option. Here you can explicitly select which act should be the first act of the show.

This configuration ensures proper script ordering and is essential for the script editor to function correctly.
