## Running a Live Show

Going to the **Sessions** tab will show previous live sessions, as well as allowing you to start
(and stop) a new live session.

Clicking on the *Start Session* button will start a new live session and navigate you, and all other
connected clients, to the live show page.

This live view shows you the script and cues, as well as the current run time of the session and 
page of the script that the top script line is on. There is also the *End Show* button at the
bottom of the script, which will stop the current live session.

### Automatic Script Following

The user who starts the show session will become the leader for the duration of that session. All
other connected clients (logged in or not) will follow the view of the script of the leader. If for
whatever reason, the leader's client becomes disconnected, then all other clients will become
"orphaned" and will be able to control their own script. When any client logged in as the user
becomes connected, it will automatically take over leadership duties, and all orphaned clients
will be brouht back in line.
